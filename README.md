🤟 SignBridge AI

Speak. Sign. Understand.

SignBridge AI is an accessibility-focused platform that converts spoken or typed language into meaningful Indian Sign Language (ISL) concepts and presents them through a 3D human avatar.

3D Avatar Animation

The current prototype uses single-sign animation. A sentence is converted into meaningful ISL concepts and the avatar plays the available signs sequentially.

Example:

"Hi, what are you doing?"
        ↓
HI → WHAT → YOU → DO
        ↓
Individual sign animations

3D avatar

📖 ISL Sign Database

The sign database is the source of truth for vocabulary and animation mapping.

Planned schema:

sign_id
canonical_gloss
word
synonyms
category
animation_id
animation_available
source
notes

Example:

S001,HI,hi,"hey|hello",Greeting,HI,true,ISLRTC,Core greeting
S002,WHAT,what,,Question,WHAT,true,ISLRTC,Question sign
S003,WHEN,when,,Question,WHEN,false,ISLRTC,Animation pending

Important

Vocabulary availability and animation availability are separate.

SIGN EXISTS
    ≠
ANIMATION EXISTS

The application must never replace an unavailable sign with an unrelated animation.

🎬 Single-Sign Mode

The current development direction is:

Input
 ↓
Meaningful concepts
 ↓
Canonical ISL glosses
 ↓
Sign database
 ↓
Individual animations
 ↓
Existing avatar

Examples:

Hi
→ HI
→ HI animation

Where is the hospital?
→ HOSPITAL → WHERE
→ individual animations

The avatar itself is treated as a fixed component while the vocabulary and translation system are expanded.

Text and audio are intended to use the same ISL mapping pipeline.

⚠️ Animation Availability

The UI should clearly distinguish:

HI
✓ Animated

from:

WHEN
⚠ Animation pending

The system should not:

play a random animation

use HELLO as a fallback for another sign

claim an unavailable animation is complete

📈 Roadmap

Phase 1 — Foundation

Speech input

Text input

Speech-to-text

Initial sign database

3D avatar

Single-sign playback

Phase 2 — Sign Database

Clean existing vocabulary

Expand toward 500+ useful ISL concepts

Add synonyms and categories

Track animation availability

Add database validation

Phase 3 — AI Translation

Improve sentence meaning extraction

Improve ISL concept ordering

Improve multilingual semantic mapping

Add context-aware translation

Phase 4 — Production Database

Supabase PostgreSQL

User profiles

Translation history

Saved phrases

Learning progress

Phase 5 — Deployment

Production frontend

Production backend

Secure environment variables

Cloud deployment

Performance optimization

▶️ Run Locally

Streamlit

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

Open:

http://localhost:8501

Node / Express

npm install
npm run start

Backend:

http://localhost:5000

🔐 Security

Never commit:

.env
API keys
passwords
tokens
private credentials

Use environment variables for secrets.

🧪 Basic Tests

Try:

Hi
What?
When?
How?
Where?
I need water
Help me
Where is the hospital?

Verify:

correct transcript

correct ISL concept

correct animation lookup

correct sequence count

correct avatar playback

unavailable animations are reported honestly

📌 Project Status

Active Development

SignBridge AI is currently a working prototype. The vocabulary database, animation coverage, semantic translation, and production database architecture are being expanded.

A vocabulary count should not be treated as the same number of completed avatar animations.

🎯 Vision

SignBridge AI aims to make communication more accessible by connecting:

Any supported spoken language
        ↓
Speech / Text
        ↓
Meaning
        ↓
Indian Sign Language
        ↓
3D Human Avatar
